I'm a Utopian Software Designer who likes to drink lots of coffee and beer.

I live in Mexico City, I like to code for the JVM with Groovy, Java, Clojure and few times with Scala. I like Go, Haskell and Erlang also.

The most exciting thing I can do is to think about software design. I love to design software, thinking about the value I can provide with beautiful designs. The most scalable designs I've ever created always has been involved a team, I can't achieve goals without a motivated team. Motivation is everything to get inspiration.

> Life is about design, mostly emergent design, live design

I have several interests.
